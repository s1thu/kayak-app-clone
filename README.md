# Kayak App Thingyan Challenge

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for the Kayak App Thingyan Challenge, a project developed as part of a coding challenge. The challenge involved building a kayak app using Swift, incorporating a UI kit, and implementing various design patterns such as delegate protocol pattern for data-driven development for UI and backend, as well as MVC and MVVM patterns for code refactoring.

## Features
- UIKIT: The app utilizes a UI kit for designing the user interface, providing a visually appealing and intuitive experience for users.
  
- SWIFT: The entire project is built using Swift, a powerful and intuitive programming language for iOS development.

- Delegate Protocol Pattern: The delegate protocol pattern is employed for facilitating communication between different components of the app, enabling a modular and flexible architecture.

- MVC Pattern: The Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern is utilized for organizing the codebase, separating concerns, and improving maintainability.

- MVVM Pattern: Additionally, the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) pattern is employed for code refactoring, enhancing testability and scalability of the application.
